ACM-ICPC 
===============

List of algorithms and data structures for algorithmic programming competitions (International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI),  ACM International Collegiate Programming Competition (ICPC), Google Code Jam, Facebook Hacker Cup, etc.).

In the past, this list has been quite useful for solving algorithmic programming challenges on online judges like the Sphere Online Judge (SPOJ) and competitions.

Most of this has been coded during high-school (2008-2010) while preparing for the IOI. Consider this a disclaimer about the coding style. I will try to improve the code whenever I have some free time. If you see any errors, please feel free to set an issue, or even better, make a pull request.

The code is licensed under the MIT License, free to use, have fun!
